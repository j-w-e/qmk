# Hugh's keymap

This is a custom, mostly 36-key keymap specifically for Hugh.

It draws on a range of code from multiple users, that I have shamelessly just copied and modified to suit my own purposes.

1. Case modes from here: https://github.com/andrewjrae/kyria-keymap#case-modes
2. Callum mods from here: https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/users/callum (though I have adapted the one-shot shift so that the first tap enables shift, and then the second tap enables caps word). Have also added the ctrl-gui swap function, depending if you're in windows or mac mode.
3. Callum swapper, for cmd-tab and alt-tab, but with the added function of being able to use shift to cycle backwards through windows


Still to do:

1. Add semantic keys from https://github.com/moutis/HandsDown
3. Add layer indications and led indicators to highlight the arrow keys, for example.
